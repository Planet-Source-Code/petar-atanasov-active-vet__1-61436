Active VET is complete veterinary managment software, 
designed to serve small and middle vet practicing consulting rooms.
Current version includes roentgenography module, 
clinical and laboratory information module, therapy and diagnose modules. 

Actve Vet uses Access 2000 as backend database. The whole application is designed completely to the MVC architecture.
AV is designed to serve in a journal principal - which means that every month (or whenever the users decides)
the db must be cleaned and replaced with new emtpy copy. 

One of the future upgrades which I consider to create is wrapper module to maintain small journal archives.
The consolidating module will be responsible for storing archves 
and will manage the report module (witch will serve representative queries).
Consider AV as a vet diary, it needs a library where separate data portions will be stored, sorted 
and easily searched for particuar criteria.

Future upgrades list:
	1 Convert the source code to C#
	2 Extend the reports module (or maybe recreate it in the wrapper module)
	3 Create wrapper module for consolidating  and maintaining small journals
	4 Create localized versions of AV 
	5 Implement cutom display settings based on user requirments
	6 Implement security profiles

Spash screen design and main toolbar icons are created by my friend Plamen (http://plamen.illuminative.org/),
